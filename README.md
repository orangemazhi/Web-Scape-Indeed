# Web-Scape-Indeed
Finding a job is a tough and exhausting task. In this project, with the initial idea to help MSBA students, we web scraped the employment-related search engine Indeed, which can assist them to get familiar with the job market and provide them with insights on the necessary skill sets to succeed in finding their dream job in the business analytics field. Specifically, we chose San Francisco Bay area as our location of interest with the intention of providing resources to SF Bay area individuals and businesses. Eventually, we built a Mysql database that stored well structured data for query optimization and data security. Our Indeed database is an exhausting list that comprises the company’s information and job-related data. This database can provide students with a dataset that captures different jobs posts from Indeed, which can be analyzed to understand the job market demand, in terms of job titles, skills, experiences, salary and locations. In addition, our Indeed database provides a great resource for recruiting firms to oversee industry and trends and find partnerships with other companies. For education agencies, it’s easier to find common practices and skill sets to design educational courses and industry-related seminars to train employees.
